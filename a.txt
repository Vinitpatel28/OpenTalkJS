In the forest, where trees are tall,
A gentle breeze whispers through it all.
The rustling leaves, a soothing sound,
As nature's beauty wraps around.

The sun shines bright, with warm rays high,
Bringing life to the world, as it passes by.
The flowers bloom, in every hue,
A colorful tapestry, for me and you.

The river flows, with gentle stream,
Reflecting sky, in its tranquil dream.
The fish swim deep, with scales of blue,
A world beneath, where secrets brew.

In nature's heart, a rhythm beats,
A symphony, that our souls greet.
A place to breathe, to rest and roam,
Where the beauty of life, we call home.

So let us wander, in this grand scene,
And find solace, in its peaceful sheen.
For nature's beauty, it knows no bounds,
A gift to us all, a treasure profound.
