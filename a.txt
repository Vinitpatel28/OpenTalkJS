In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees stand tall, their leaves aflame,
A fiery glow that lights the name.

The river's voice, a gentle song,
Echoes through the valleys all day long.
Its waters flow, a steady beat,
A soothing melody that repeats.

The sun rises, paint the sky,
With colors bold, and vibrant high.
The clouds are pink, the birds take flight,
As morning dawns, with all its might.

The mountains rise, a rugged shore,
Where eagles soar, and wolves roar.
Their spirits wild, their hearts aflame,
They rule the peaks, in their domain.

In nature's realm, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, our worries release.
For in her beauty, we are made new,
And our souls take flight, with all they can do.
