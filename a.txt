In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
Nature's symphony begins to sway,
The wind whispers secrets in my ear,
Of forests deep and mountains clear.

The sun's warm touch upon my skin,
Awakens life within the vine,
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their stories yet untold.

The river flows, a winding stream,
Through valleys green and ancient dream,
Its gentle lapping, soothing sound,
Echoes through the wilderness around.

The flowers bloom, a colorful sight,
Dancing in the breeze's soft light,
Their sweet perfume, a heavenly treat,
Fills my heart with joy and peace to meet.

The stars appear, a twinkling show,
A celestial tapestry below,
The moon, a glowing orb of white,
 Illuminates the darkness of night.

In nature's realm, I find my way,
Through forests dark, or sun-kissed day,
For in its beauty, I am free,
To breathe, to live, wild and carefree.
